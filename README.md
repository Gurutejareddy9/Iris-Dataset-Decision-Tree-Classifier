# Iris Dataset Decision Tree Classifier
 This Python script applies a Decision Tree Classifier to the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.The process involves:
1.	Loading the Dataset: Using the Iris dataset provided by sklearn.
2.	Data Splitting: Dividing the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets.
3.	Model Training: Training a Decision Tree Classifier using the training data.
4.	Evaluation: Predicting the labels of the test set and calculating accuracy.
5.	Visualization: Plotting the decision tree for interpretability, showing feature splits, and classification paths.

The output includes the model accuracy and a graphical representation of the decision tree to visualize the decision-making process.
